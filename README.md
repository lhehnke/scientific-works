Selected papers and essays from my Bachelor's and Master's programmes at the Universities of [Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/eng/) and [Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/) (mostly in German). They generally take an integrative approach to research, connecting historical analyses with social science theories and computational methods or synthesize findings from fields such as I/O psychology and network analysis.
